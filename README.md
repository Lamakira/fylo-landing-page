## My process

In this project, I follow the mobile first approch to build the landing page. And I also use some of global classes on my divs to reduce styling and to have more handing on my styling process. Some of the global classes that I use : 
- padding-global : to define the padding left and ridht on all my sections
- padding-section : to define the padding top and bottom on all my sections
- container : have a max-width set to 80rem.
Using these global classes allowed me to reduce padding across the whole landing page just by changing the value at class level, which was much more affordable than having to do it on each section individually. 

### What I learned

I've learned to better understand the 'mobile first' approach, which means that a lot less code needs to be written to manage responsive design.
